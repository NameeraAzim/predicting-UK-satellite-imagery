A deep learning model that uses various layers, including GRU, to predict the next two hours of satellite imagery given twelve images from the previous hour. This project was a submission for the Climate Hack AI competition hosted by UCL for students from the top 25 universities around the world in an effort to "improve solar photovoltaic power output predictions" to "help the National Grid Electricity System Operator minimise the use of standby natural gas turbines, potentially saving up to 100 kilotonnes of carbon emissions a year". This model has an accuracy of 
62.879%.

The model can be found in the model.py file in the submission folder which, along with the loss and training files, is located in the climatehack_getting_started folder. 

Note: the loss function was provided by the organizers.
